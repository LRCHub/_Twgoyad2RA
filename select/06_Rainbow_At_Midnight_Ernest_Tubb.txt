After the war was over
I was coming home to you
I saw a rainbow at midnight
Out on the ocean blue

The stars in heaven were shining
The moon gave its light from above
I saw your face in this rainbow
And it made me think of our love
[Incomprehensible]

We'll build a home in the country
And make all our dreams come true
There we will make a heaven
Sweetheart, for just we two

Here we will live so happy
And have a baby or two
We'll name them after the rainbow
Because it reminds me of you
[Incomprehensible]

After this life is over
And our journey here is through
We'll move to the land of the rainbow
And live in the starry blue
